# Early Detection of Lung Cancer
## Introduction
This project is based on the [LUNA16](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/) dataset. The goal is to detect lung cancer in CT scans. The dataset contains 888 CT scans with annotations. The annotations are in the form of a 3D segmentation mask. This project is covered in the book [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-pytorch) by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann. The code in this repository is based on the code in the book. The book is a great resource for learning PyTorch. I highly recommend it. This repository is a sequel of the repository covering the first part of the book. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Nordiniv/Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch), I decided to seperate them for this project to be more standalone.

## Environment
The code in this repository is written in Python 3.10. The dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file, for the requirements and usage, please refer to the [prequel repository](https://github.com/Nordiniv/Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch). The code is written in Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts. The notebooks are in the `notebooks` folder and the scripts are in the `scripts` folder. The notebooks are numbered in the order they should be run. The scripts are numbered in the order they are used in the notebooks. The scripts are used to train the models and the notebooks are used to visualize the results. The notebooks are also used to explain the code. The notebooks are written in Markdown and LaTeX.
